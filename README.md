### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mukund Agarwal. I like making things, and building stuff (engineering).
I also like to spend my time playing a bunch of sports like badminton, table tennis, cricket and chess.

If you can't find me in the real world, you can always catch up here. (I will build an interactive interface for this soon).
